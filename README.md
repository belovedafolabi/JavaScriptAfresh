# Welcome to JavaScriptAfresh - Form Validation Fun! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

Hi there! Welcome to my JavaScriptAfresh repo, where I'm documenting every lesson learned on my journey to relearn JavaScript. This project showcases a simple yet powerful form validation example using vanilla JavaScript. Join me as I explore and master the fundamentals of JS all over again!

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's how you can get started:

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/belovedafolabi/JavaScriptAfresh.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd javascript-relearn-journey
   ```
3. **Open the Project**:
   Open `index.html` in your favorite browser to see the form in action.

## The Project

In this project, I focus on form validation, specifically validating a username field. It's a perfect example to understand how JavaScript can enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback.

### HTML

The HTML structure is simple and clean, featuring a form with an input field for the username and a submit button. The form's layout is styled to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code handles the validation logic with a regex pattern that checks the username against specific criteria. When the form is submitted, the script prevents the default action and validates the input, providing immediate feedback:

- **Form Submission**: I wrote JavaScript code that prevents the form's default action and checks the username against a regex pattern, ensuring it meets the criteria.
- **Live Feedback**: As the user types, the script provides real-time feedback, indicating whether the username is valid. This feedback is displayed directly in the form, enhancing the user experience.
